# Deck Brief: Introducción a DevOps: fundamentos, evolución y ruta de aprendizaje

This file is the source of truth for this deck.

## Source Prompt

```text
Create a Spanish Slidev presentation titled "Introducción a DevOps:
fundamentos, evolución y ruta de aprendizaje" for beginner to
early-intermediate technology learners. Duration: 60 minutes, with 45-50
minutes of content and 10-15 minutes of Q&A. Include two personal iceberg
introduction slides before technical content, then cover DevOps fundamentals,
DevSecOps, Platform Engineering, tooling categories, cloud, observability,
learning path, certifications, close, and Q&A. Use palette-crystal, Spanish
text, no live demo, vendor-neutral examples where possible, and validate with
make check DECK=intro-devops-es.

Later revision: switch to a dark background, make CI/CD the key skeleton of
the talk, expand the content depth for a full hour, and add a final questions
slide.
```

## Assumptions

- The exact organization name "DevSecOps Village" is kept as provided by the prompt and marked for speaker validation in the slide note.
- The user later provided a certification list. The deck highlights the most relevant credentials for a DevOps/DevSecOps/Platform Engineering session as compact visual badges instead of a full text list.
- The two iceberg slides use a deck-local Vue/SVG illustration instead of an external image so both states stay aligned and render offline.
- The deck includes both the requested personal introduction slides and the repository-required data-driven speaker profile slide.
- After visual QA feedback, the opening explicitly frames DevOps as a mindset and cultural change that unites development and operations before introducing tools.
- After user feedback, the deck uses a dark background, treats CI/CD as the core skeleton for explaining DevOps, and expands the technical body for a 60-minute session.
- The deck targets 39 slides with the final 10-15 minutes reserved for Q&A.

## Questions Resolved Before Execution

- Critical context is complete in the user-provided prompt; no blocking clarification questions were required.
- Certifications are based on the user-provided list and curated for relevance to the talk.
- Local deployment before push is required by the latest user instruction.
- The requested final questions are implemented as a separate final Q&A slide, not only as prompts inside the closing slide.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Narrative

The deck shall explain DevOps to beginner and early-intermediate learners in a clear 60-minute story.

Acceptance:

- Given the target audience
- When they finish the deck
- Then they understand DevOps as a discipline that connects development, operations, security, quality, observability, cloud, and developer experience

### Required Content

The deck shall include every required point from the source prompt.

Acceptance:

- Given the required points list
- When `slides.md` is reviewed
- Then each point appears in at least one slide or visual block

### Required Structure

The deck shall include mandatory and user-requested structural slides.

Acceptance:

- Given the rendered deck
- When it is reviewed
- Then it includes a cover, two consecutive iceberg personal intro slides, a data-driven speaker profile, agenda, technical body, close, and Q&A

### Visual Quality

The deck shall use the repository visual system, remain readable at 1440x900, and avoid long static text runs.

Acceptance:

- Given screenshots of every slide and visible click/state
- When inspected at 1440x900
- Then there is no clipped text, overlapping essential content, unreadable contrast, broken renderer, or underused component opportunity
- And image-bearing slides use local, source-noted assets selected for their
  semantic role

### Build And Local Preview

The deck shall pass repository validation and be deployed locally before push.

Acceptance:

- `make check DECK=intro-devops-es` exits with code 0
- `make dev DECK=intro-devops-es PORT=<available>` runs locally
- Browser screenshots confirm the deck renders

## Validation Plan

- `make check DECK=intro-devops-es`
- Local preview with `make dev DECK=intro-devops-es PORT=4100` or another available port
- Screenshot review at 1440x900 for every slide and visible click/state
- Slidev overview screenshot review because previous feedback showed thumbnail overlap/clipping
- Explicitly check cover, iceberg slides, speaker profile, comparison, lifecycle, CI/CD mockup, observability mockup, learning path, close, Q&A, and navigation
- No remote dependency for essential rendering

## Handoff Notes

- Commands run: `git diff --check`; `make check DECK=intro-devops-es`; `make dev DECK=intro-devops-es PORT=4100`; Playwright screenshot pass at 1440x900 across 71 visible states; Slidev overview screenshot capture; targeted screenshot recheck for deployment matrix, credentials, closing, and questions slides.
- Files changed: `decks/intro-devops-es/`, `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/skills/slide-deck-generator/SKILL.md`, `docs/deck-generation-workflow.md`, `docs/deck-brief-template.md`, and `docs/slide-guidelines.md`.
- Known limitations: certification badges are deck-local visual badges using compact code/issuer marks, not official third-party badge artwork.
- Follow-up ideas: replace visual marks with official certification badge artwork if the speaker provides approved image assets; validate the exact public organization label for DevSecOps Village before public delivery.
