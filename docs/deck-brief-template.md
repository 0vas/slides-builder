# Deck Brief: <title>

This file is the source of truth for a deck created by `slides-builder`.
Complete it before scaffolding slides. If a critical field is missing or
contradictory, ask the user before creating files. Ask all known clarification
questions during triage/plan; after execution starts, use documented
assumptions unless a newly discovered blocker could not reasonably have been
identified earlier.

## Intake

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Topic or title | <required> |
| Audience | <required> |
| Audience level | <required> |
| Duration | <required> |
| Desired outcome | <required> |
| Required points | <required> |
| Tone and context | <required> |
| Constraints | <required> |
| Available assets | <none or list> |
| Suggested assets policy | <SVG Repo, Pexels, Unsplash, no external sourcing, etc.> |
| Speaker profile | <use shared speaker data? yes/no/variant> |
| Deliverables | <HTML, PDF, PPTX, GitHub Pages, release package> |
| Desired slug | <optional> |
| Background mode | <light, dark, black/keynote> |
| Palette | <palette-* class> |

## Visual Direction

| Item | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Background mode | <light, dark, black/keynote> |
| Palette | <palette-* class> |
| Palette rationale | <why it fits the audience, tone, and topic> |
| Motion level | <low, medium, high> |
| Media style | <screenshots, generated images, diagrams, ECharts, Mermaid, 3D> |

If the user does not provide a visual direction and allows the agent to infer,
use `palette-crystal` and `light` mode. Use `black/keynote` only when the user
requests it or the presentation context clearly justifies it.
