Agent-ready Slidev workspace for building, validating, versioning, and
publishing reusable presentation decks.

This repository is designed for an agent role called `slides-builder`.
`slides-builder` turns a user prompt into a clean deck: it asks for missing
critical context, writes a local brief, reuses the component catalog, searches
for appropriate image assets when a slide needs them, validates the result, and
leaves the deck ready to build, export, deploy, or release.
When a defect is found and fixed, the agent records the reusable lesson in the
narrowest durable spec, skill, doc, template, or validator so future decks do
not repeat it.

## Who This Is For

- Speakers who want presentations as code.
- AI agents that need clear rules instead of ad-hoc slide generation.
- Teams that want reusable components, styles, speaker data, and publishing
  workflows across decks.

Human entry point: this README.
Agent entry point: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and
[.agents/skills/](.agents/skills/).

Pull requests are welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the
quality gates and PR flow.

## Available Decks

| Deck | Purpose | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `github-enterprise-platform` | Main talk about GitHub as an enterprise platform. | `make dev DECK=github-enterprise-platform` |
| `platform-engineering-that-teams-actually-adopt` | Internal platform engineering adoption and operating-model talk. | `make dev DECK=platform-engineering-that-teams-actually-adopt` |
| `component-showcase` | Reference deck for the current component and style catalog. | `make dev DECK=component-showcase` |

`decks/_template/` is not a finished talk. It is a clean starting point with
lorem ipsum, local wrappers, and minimal examples.

## Work With Slides-builder

Give `slides-builder` the talk objective, audience, duration, tone,
constraints, required points, available assets, and desired visual direction.
If critical information is missing, the agent must ask all known clarification
questions before execution starts, during triage/plan.

Recommended flow:

```text
Triage -> Questions -> Intake -> Brief -> Plan -> Tasks -> Implement -> Validate -> Learn -> Handoff
```

All known clarification questions belong in `Triage`, `Questions`, or `Plan`
before execution starts. After implementation begins, the agent should proceed
from documented assumptions instead of pausing for new preference questions,
unless a genuinely new blocker appears.

### Example Prompt

When the prompt is executed from this repository, `AGENTS.md` and the project
skills already define how the agent must work. The user prompt should focus on
the presentation itself. Copy and adapt this example:

```text
Create a presentation titled "Platform Engineering That Teams Actually Adopt".

Audience: engineering managers, platform engineers, and senior developers.
Audience level: intermediate.
Duration: 30 minutes.
Event context: an internal engineering conference where teams are evaluating
whether to invest in a platform organization.

Goal: attendees should leave with a practical operating model for building,
adopting, and measuring an internal developer platform.

Core message: a platform succeeds when teams choose to use it, not merely when
the organization deploys more tools.

The presentation must cover:
- the difference between a platform and a collection of tools,
- product thinking and developer experience,
- golden paths and self-service workflows,
- governance and security without unnecessary friction,
- adoption and outcome metrics,
- a phased implementation roadmap.

Tone: practical, candid, and executive-friendly. Use concrete examples and
delivery trade-offs. Avoid marketing language and beginner-level definitions.

Presentation constraints:
- reserve the final 5 minutes for questions,
- do not depend on a live demo,
- keep product references vendor-neutral,
- include a concise closing takeaway and recommended next steps.

Available material: I do not have images or diagrams yet. I can provide the
event logo later if needed.

Visual preference: a light, modern, editorial style with restrained motion.
Favor diagrams, one clear data visualization, and a few strong images over
dense text or dashboard-like slides.
```

Every new deck must have `decks/<slug>/deck.brief.md` created from
[docs/deck-brief-template.md](docs/deck-brief-template.md). The brief is the
source of truth for requirements, assumptions, asset plan, visual mode, and
validation.

## Agent Discovery

- `.agents/skills/` is the canonical project skill location and is discovered
  directly by Agent Skills-compatible tools, including GitHub Copilot.
- `.github/agents/slides-builder.agent.md` exposes the `slides-builder` custom
  agent to GitHub Copilot CLI and supported Copilot surfaces.
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` is a thin Copilot entry point;
  `AGENTS.md` remains the canonical repository specification.
- Run `npm run check:agent` to validate all discovery assets.
- Restart Copilot CLI after pulling changes so it reloads project agents and
  skills, then select `slides-builder` with `/agent` or `--agent slides-builder`.

## Required Prompt Inputs

A useful prompt should include:

- topic or title,
- audience and audience level,
- duration,
- desired outcome,
- required points,
- tone and context,
- constraints,
- available assets,
- visual background mode: light, dark, or black/keynote.

If only non-critical details are missing, such as slug, palette, or suggested
assets, the agent may infer them and record the assumption in the brief.

Every deck must include a title/cover slide, a data-driven speaker profile
slide, and a final close/Q&A slide.

For new decks or substantial visual changes, visual validation must inspect
every slide and visible click/state at 1440x900. Small isolated edits must
inspect every changed slide plus adjacent or risky slides.

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

Or:

```bash
make install
```

## Daily Commands

```bash
make list
make dev DECK=github-enterprise-platform
make build DECK=github-enterprise-platform
make check DECK=github-enterprise-platform
make build-all
make pdf DECK=github-enterprise-platform
make pptx DECK=github-enterprise-platform
npm run check:agent
```

Equivalent npm commands:

```bash
npm run list
npm run dev -- github-enterprise-platform
npm run build -- github-enterprise-platform
npm run build:all
npm run export:pdf -- github-enterprise-platform
npm run export:pptx -- github-enterprise-platform
```

`make dev` validates the requested deck, accepts an unambiguous close typo, and
frees the requested `PORT` if another process is listening there.

PPTX export is a static delivery format. Slidev exports PPTX slides as images,
so native PowerPoint click animations are not preserved. For live click-driven
motion, use the hosted Slidev web deck. For PPTX handoff, model click steps as
separate Slidev click states or explicit slides. See
[docs/pptx-export-limits.md](docs/pptx-export-limits.md).

## Versioning And Release

The workspace uses SemVer. Version `1.0.0` is the first stable release of the
`slides-builder` workspace.

Prepare a release:

```bash
npm run release:prepare -- 1.0.0
make release-check VERSION=1.0.0
make build-all
```

After committing and pushing the version change, run the **Release Package**
workflow with `version = 1.0.0`. The workflow validates the repo, creates the
annotated tag `v1.0.0`, creates `slides-builder-1.0.0.tgz`, and publishes a
GitHub Release.

Details:

- [docs/release-workflow.md](docs/release-workflow.md)
- [docs/adr/0002-slides-builder-release-workflow.md](docs/adr/0002-slides-builder-release-workflow.md)

## Deployment

The **Deploy Slides** workflow publishes GitHub Pages:

- `target = all`: publish every deck under `dist/<deck>/`.
- `target = <slug>`: publish one deck.
- `target = custom`: provide a deck slug manually.

Before the first deployment, enable GitHub Pages in **Settings > Pages** and set
the source to **GitHub Actions**. The workflow does not try to create the Pages
site because some repository or organization policies block that call for
`GITHUB_TOKEN`.

The generated home at `dist/index.html` renders deck cards with preview, title,
and description from each deck frontmatter.

## Media And Data Rules

- Deck-owned media lives in `decks/<slug>/public/media/`.
- Reference public assets as `media/<file>` from Markdown or props.
- From Vue components, build public asset paths with `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`.
- Stable speaker data and shared personal assets live in `data/speaker/`.
- Deck-specific speaker overrides live in `decks/<slug>/data/speaker.js`.
- When a slide needs an image, search SVG Repo, Pexels, Unsplash, Pixabay, or
  similar reputable free-media sources as part of the slide implementation.
  Download assets locally, choose distinct images for distinct slide roles, and
  record source/license notes.

## Components

Reusable components live in `shared/components/`. Slidev auto-imports only
deck-local components, so use a thin wrapper under `decks/<slug>/components/`
when a deck needs a shared component.

Current shared components include:

| Component | Primary Use |
| --- | --- |
| `SpeakerProfile` | Data-driven speaker intro with QR and public profiles. |
| `TypingTitle` | Clean title reveal for covers and section breaks. |
| `PlatformMap` | Stages, domains, or transformation maps. |
| `EnterpriseTopology` | Compact enterprise dependency map. |
| `GovernanceGrid` | 2x2 governance or operating model grid. |
| `SecurityRadar` | Capability, risk, or posture radar. |

See [docs/component-catalog.md](docs/component-catalog.md) for usage rules.

## Styles And Palettes

Decks choose a palette through `class` and `defaults.class`:

```md
---
class: my-deck palette-crystal
defaults:
  class: my-deck palette-crystal
---
```

`palette-crystal` is the recommended default for new decks, templates, and the
showcase. Dark and black/keynote modes must be deliberate and recorded in the
deck brief.

See [docs/style-catalog.md](docs/style-catalog.md).
